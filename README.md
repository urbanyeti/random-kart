# random-kart
Procedurally generated text descriptions of characters and scenarios for wacky, sci-fi racing. Think Mario Kart mixed with Podracing mixed with Wacky Racers.

### What?
I wanted to create a large racing tournament for a science fiction TTRPG that I was GMing so I wrote some python to procedurally generate racers, locations, and events.

### Oh, okay

## Example Events
- "You are ambushed by a sleepy kangaroo-chipmunk hybrid."
- "A possessed man wearing green activates a rocket jump and takes the lead."
- "A swarm of giraffe-crab hybrids surround you."

- "A satellite owned by a wealthy syndicate"
- "A planet with an ancient secret"
